Enjoy tracking your budget!
  ## Description
  Every adult should be tracking their expenses on a monthly basis, and sometimes it can be difficult to do. So this project was created to help ease the frustrations of other apps and programs. With its simplistic design, one can quickly add and subtract funds to their budget and get a visual readout of their expenses.

  ## Installation
  The app runs fully on Heroku and does not need installation, unless running on a local machine. Then run your standard 'npm init' and 'npm install' commands.
